**Cautionary Measures for Red Hen Mentors**:
1. Do not delete files or folders because some tasks are sequential and may take more than a week for completion. Therefore, if the important files which are needed for the next step are deleted, you will have to wait for the task to be completed before moving to the next step.
The best way to overcome this issue is to `cat [filename].out` to verify the progress. 
2. During verification process in the evaluation stage, you can `scancel` the slurm task in the queue if necessary to release the compute nodes resources.
